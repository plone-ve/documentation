Installing Python is beyond the scope of this documentation.
However, it is recommended to use a Python version manager, {term}`pyenv`, that allows you to install multiple versions of Python on your development environment without destroying your system's Python.

Plone 6.0 requires Python version {{SUPPORTED_PYTHON_VERSIONS_PLONE60}}.

```{versionadded} Plone 6.0.14 
Support for Python 3.13.
```

```{versionremoved} Plone 6.0.14
Support for Python 3.8.
```

```{warning}
Do not create or activate a Python virtual environment at this time.
The instructions below will create one.
