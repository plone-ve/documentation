# Developer guide

This part of the documentation provides information for how to develop in Plone.

```{note}
This part of the documentation is under construction.
You can find documentation for development in various locations through the [search feature](https://6.docs.plone.org/search.html?q=development).
You can help consolidate all of development documentation here, even if it is to let us know what is missing, by [creating an issue](https://github.com/plone/documentation/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=new-issue-form.yml).
